add Trimmomatic step and another fastqc afterward

ideally, there'd just be an 'analyze_reads' command that takes a path; path contains .fastq files. after running, there's a folder containing fastq analysis, a folder containing reads trimmed with trimmomatic, and a folder containing fastq analysis of the trimmed reads.

oh yeah also need a config file for trimmomatic args.
